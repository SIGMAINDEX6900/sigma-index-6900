            <div class="narrative-chapter fade-in">
                <h3>Chapter 1: The Myth of SIGMA</h3>
                <p>In a hidden corner of the blockchain, a token emerged with an epic destiny: SIGMA INDEX 6900. Born in the chaos of the meme world, it quickly became a legend. SIGMA represents strength, independence, and the rebellious spirit of the “lone wolf” in crypto—the kind of individual who goes against the grain and wins. But, like many mythological heroes, the token was dumped, forgotten, and left deep in the net, like a hidden gem waiting to be rediscovered.</p>
